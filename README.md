<h1> Simple-NN </h1>
<p>A simple Neural Network. It was project made as a part of the Supervised Learning course.</p>
<h2>Project Parts</h2>
<p>The project consists of 3 main parts</p>
<h3>1. Neuron Class</h3>
<p>A class that holds the neuron's data such as weights, output, and activation function (Sigmoid).</p>
<h3>2. Network Creation</h3>
<p>A function to create a network of neurons. You can specify the input features count and number of neurons in each layer.</p>
<h3>3. Training</h3>
<p>Training was achieved by basic forward and backward propagation using the Least Square Error as a loss function.</p>
